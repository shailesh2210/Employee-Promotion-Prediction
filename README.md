## Employee-Promotion-Prediction End-to-End Project
## Employee promotion prediction
This project is a machine learning project that predicts employee promotion. It is used to identify employees who are most likely to be promoted.

The project uses a variety of factors to predict employee promotion, such as performance reviews, training history, and awards won. The project is accurate and fair, and it does not discriminate against employees on the basis of factors.


## Goal of this project
